Last year, several people shared their list of default apps, and it was fun to follow the various blogs and see what people have been using.

If you're interested, [Robb Knight](https://social.lol/@robb){: rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank" } keeps a [list](https://defaults.rknight.me/){: rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank" } of everyone who has joined.
