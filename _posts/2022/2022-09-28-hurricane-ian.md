This is one of those moments where we have to embrace ourselves and wish for hope for our fellows from Cuba and Florida.

Last year we've been hit hard by Hurricane Ida, and I experienced it first-hand. That was the first time that I feared for myself and my family.

I wish all the people who live in poor conditions to be able to find safe shelter and health support. I'm happy for those who were able to leave town, and hope your houses and businesses are safe when you're back.
