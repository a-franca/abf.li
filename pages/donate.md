If you enjoyed any of my content or something that I wrote helped or inspired you in any way, you can make a donation to show your support.[^1]

## How are donations used?

All money donated goes towards domain renewal costs and [open source software and services I use myself](/uses).

Anything "extra" ends up getting me a coffee to make sure I remain caffeinated to publish more content.

### Standard Donations


- [Buy Me a Coffee]({{ site.donate.kofi }}){:rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank"}  
- [Directly through Stripe]({{ site.donate.stripe }}){:rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank"}

[^1]: Please don't feel obligated to donate. You can still enjoy everything on this blog for free. Even better, [get in touch](/#contact) so we can have a friendly conversation.
