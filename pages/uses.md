[^1]: In the recent past, I've been using Joplin due to the ability to encrypt my notes. Obsidian sync plan ($8, billed yearly) is still a bit overkill to me, however with the new Advanced Data Protection for iCloud, I decided to go back to Obsidian.

[^2]: Nextcloud and Cryptomator were used in place of iCloud+ (shared with my family), but again, with Advanced Data Protection for iCloud I simply can't justify the headache of managing one more VPS.

[^3]: Everything in Tailscale is Open Source, except the GUI clients for proprietary OS (Windows and macOS/iOS), and the control server.
